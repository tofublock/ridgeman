 Ridgeman
 grabs DEM data from Copernicus Geotiff and plots to SVG and PNG according to a few parameters.
 
TODO
-Scale output image properly so everything that needs to be drawn fits on it
-Replace SCALE and STRETCH by ANGLE and calculate stretching and scaling from viewing angle
-Input parameters from Geocoordinates instead of offset and size
